## Contribution Areas

### Hardware
- **Objective**: Enhance or optimize the BLDC motor driver hardware design.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review and improve the PCB layout for thermal management or signal integrity.
  - Suggest alternative components for cost reduction or supply chain reliability.
  - Validate the design with different motor types or power requirements.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use Eagle Cad 7.7 for PCB design modifications (source files in `/gerber`).
  - Ensure compatibility with JLCPCB manufacturing (Gerber, BOM, CPL files).
  - Document changes in `/docs/hardware` with updated schematics and notes.

### Firmware
- **Objective**: Develop firmware for the nRF52840 microcontroller and DRV8316 motor driver.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement Field-Oriented Control (FOC) or trapezoidal control algorithms.
  - Develop Bluetooth communication protocols for motor control and telemetry.
  - Integrate the ICM-20948 IMU for motion-aware control.
  - Explore Zephyr RTOS for scalable firmware development.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use the Nordic SDK or Zephyr RTOS for nRF52840 development.
  - Share example code in `/firmware/examples`.
  - Test firmware on hardware and document results in `/docs/firmware`.

### Software
- **Objective**: Create software for interacting with the MotorDrive via Bluetooth or USB-C.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop a mobile app (iOS/Android) for motor control and configuration.
  - Create a desktop GUI for debugging and telemetry visualization.
  - Implement APIs for integration with IoT platforms (e.g., Hubble Network, WirePas).
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use cross-platform frameworks like Flutter or Electron for apps.
  - Document APIs in `/docs/software` with clear usage examples.
  - Ensure compatibility with the nRF52840 Bluetooth stack.

### Mechanical Design
- **Objective**: Design enclosures, mounts, or mechanical interfaces for the MotorDrive.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create 3D models for enclosures or motor mounts.
  - Design cooling solutions for high-current applications.
  - Develop mechanical interfaces for specific use cases (e.g., drones, robotics).
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use open-source tools like FreeCAD or Fusion 360.
  - Share designs in `/docs/mechanical` with STEP or STL files.
  - Include assembly instructions and compatibility notes.

### Repository Management
- **Objective**: Improve the project’s GitHub repository for better usability and collaboration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Enhance documentation in `/docs` (e.g., setup guides, tutorials).
  - Organize issues and create templates for bug reports or feature requests.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for firmware testing or documentation builds.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Follow Markdown best practices for documentation.
  - Use GitHub Actions for automation tasks.
  - Propose repository structure changes via issues.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Hardware**:
   - Obtain a MotorDrive prototype from JLCPCB using the provided Gerber, BOM, and CPL files.
   - Required tools: Soldering equipment, multimeter, oscilloscope (optional).
2. **Firmware**:
   - Install the Nordic SDK or Zephyr RTOS.
   - Set up a development environment with VS Code and PlatformIO or SEGGER Embedded Studio.
   - Use a J-Link debugger or similar for flashing the nRF52840.
3. **Software**:
   - Install Flutter, Electron, or your preferred framework for app development.
   - Test Bluetooth connectivity with tools like nRF Connect.
