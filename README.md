**PURPOSE:**
The puspose of this design is to build a global team implementing an open source generic three phase brushless direct current(BLDC) motor driver. The completed hardware design (prototype) allows turn-key manufacturing at the lowest price, jlcpcb.com.
Three files structures are necessary to upload at jlcpcb.com for turn-key manufacturing: gerber/jlcpcb6lry/jlcpcb6lyr.zip, manufacturing/DRVjlc(2)_top_cpl.csv, and manufacturing/DRVjlc(2)_top_bom.csv. This would result in the following model of the hardware:
