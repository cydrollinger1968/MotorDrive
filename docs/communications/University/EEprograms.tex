\section*{Introduction}
This document provides a partial list of state universities in the United States that offer electrical engineering programs, based on available information from web sources. The list is not exhaustive due to the lack of a comprehensive, up-to-date dataset. For complete and accurate information, please consult official university websites or accreditation bodies such as ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).

\section*{List of State Universities with Electrical Engineering Programs}
The following table lists selected state universities known to offer electrical engineering programs, organized alphabetically by state. Note that program offerings may vary, and verification with each institution is recommended.
