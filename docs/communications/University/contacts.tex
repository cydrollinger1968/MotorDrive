\section*{Introduction}
This document provides a list of state universities in the United States offering electrical engineering programs, along with contact email addresses for their electrical engineering (EE) or electrical and computer engineering (ECE) departments, where available. The list is based on general knowledge, standard university email conventions, and limited publicly available information. Email addresses may not be accurate or current and should be verified through official university websites. For departments without specific email contacts, a note is provided directing to the department’s website for further information. This document is not exhaustive, and users are encouraged to consult accreditation bodies like ABET (\url{www.abet.org}) or the National Center for Education Statistics (\url{nces.ed.gov}) for comprehensive program details.

\section*{List of State Universities and EE Department Contacts}
The following table lists selected state universities, their states, and contact email addresses for their EE or ECE departments, where known. If no specific email is available, a note directs to the department’s website for verification.

\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The universities listed are public institutions identified as state universities. Private institutions and non-state public colleges are excluded.
    \item Email addresses are based on standard university conventions (e.g., \texttt{ece@university.edu}) or known departmental contacts. Where no specific email is available, users are directed to the department’s website for contact information.
    \item No single source provided a complete list of EE department email contacts. Users should verify emails by visiting the linked department websites or contacting university switchboards.
    \item For additional resources, consult ABET’s accredited program search (\url{www.abet.org}) or the National Center for Education Statistics (\url{nces.ed.gov}).
